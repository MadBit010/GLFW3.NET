# GLFW3.NET
Automatic generated bindings of GLFW3 for .NET

## Introduction
The projects generates the bindings which are only half usable.
Reason for that is that the C-API uses headers from other API's which are not included in GLFW like OpenGL and Vulkan.
Therefore the bindings provide only names for the various unknown types, which can easily be changed to the type names from the binding you're using for OpenGL or Vulkan.

## Usage
1. Change the type mappings for the extension bindings if it's needed. 
2. Build the project
3. Run the project
4. Use the generated bindings with your bindings of OpenGL or Vulkan

## Important remarks
### Compatibility:
- Currently the project is only for VS2017
- There are generated bindings available in the _generated_ folder and may be compatible with every platform

### What we're using:
- The library uses _CppSharp_ for binding generation.
